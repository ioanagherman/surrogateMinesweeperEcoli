"""
Step 4 to X: The largest deletion segment determines the remaining low / no essentiality genes that have not been deleted.
According to ranked results from INPUT_script_4X/conquerko_red_0_endtimes.txt, repeat for yellow and blue.
These remaining genes are divided into eight groups, a powerset generated for these eight groups, and each combination from the powerset
individually appended to the current largest deletion combination and simulated.
If none of these simulations produces a dividing cell, the remaining genes are appended as single knockouts to the current largest deletion
combination and simulated. The individual remaining genes that donâ€™t produce a dividing cell are temporarily excluded and a reduced remaining gene list produced.
Expects: Place N conquerko_COLOUR_N_endtimes.txt in INPUT_script_4X folder.
Output: either bash scripts and exp / ko lists in OUTPUT_script_4X folder OR final results in OUTPUT_final
